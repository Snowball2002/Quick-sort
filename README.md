Quicksort Algorithm Implementation & Analysis
Sorting Animation

Introduction
This repository contains a comprehensive implementation and analysis of the Quicksort algorithm, one of the most efficient and widely used sorting algorithms in computer science. Quicksort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot.

Project Aims & Motivation
The primary goals of this project are to:

Implement the Quicksort algorithm in Python
Analyze its performance across various input scenarios
Compare theoretical time complexity with empirical results
Demonstrate the algorithm's efficiency for different array sizes
Provide a complete and educational resource for understanding Quicksort
Background
Quicksort Algorithm Overview
Quicksort was developed by British computer scientist Tony Hoare in 1959 and published in 1961. It remains one of the most studied and implemented sorting algorithms due to its efficiency and adaptability.

Key Features of Quicksort:
Divide-and-conquer approach: Breaks down the problem into smaller subproblems
In-place sorting: Requires minimal additional memory space
Efficient for large datasets: Average case time complexity of O(n log n)
Widely implemented: Used in many programming language libraries and systems
Time Complexity
Best case: O(n log n)
Average case: O(n log n)
Worst case: O(n²) (occurs with poorly chosen pivots)
Project Specification
Program Analysis
The implementation focuses on:

A traditional Quicksort algorithm with the last element as the pivot
Performance measurement across various input sizes and conditions
Visualization of runtime characteristics
Analysis of best, worst, and average-case scenarios
Solution Design
The solution is structured into the following components:

Core Quicksort implementation with partition function
Performance measurement utilities
Test case generators for best, worst, and average scenarios
Visualization tools for performance analysis
Implementation
Pseudocode
function quicksort(arr, low, high)
    if low < high then
        // pi is partitioning index, arr[pi] is now at right place
        pi = partition(arr, low, high)
        
        // Recursively sort elements before and after partition
        quicksort(arr, low, pi - 1)
        quicksort(arr, pi + 1, high)

function partition(arr, low, high)
    // Select the rightmost element as pivot
    pivot = arr[high]
    // Index of smaller element
    i = low - 1
    
    for j = low to high - 1 do
        // If current element is smaller than the pivot
        if arr[j] <= pivot then
            // Increment index of smaller element
            i = i + 1
            swap arr[i] with arr[j]
    
    swap arr[i + 1] with arr[high]
    return i + 1
Input Sequences
The algorithm is tested with three sequences:

Sequence A: [10, 80, 3, 19, 14, 7, 5, 12] (provided in the problem statement)
Sequence B: 100 randomly generated integers
Sequence C: 1000 randomly generated integers
Additionally, for performance analysis, we test with:

Best case: Already sorted arrays of various sizes
Worst case: Reverse-sorted arrays of various sizes
Average case: Randomly distributed arrays of various sizes
Evaluation
The performance is evaluated by:

Measuring execution time for different input sizes
Comparing best, worst, and average cases
Plotting performance graphs for visualization
Comparing empirical results with theoretical complexity bounds
The analysis confirms that:

The average case performance closely follows O(n log n) complexity
The worst case scenarios approach O(n²) complexity as expected
For larger datasets, the efficiency of Quicksort becomes apparent compared to other sorting algorithms
Results and Analysis
Computational Running Time Analysis
Theoretical Analysis:
Best Case O(n log n): Occurs when the pivot divides the array into nearly equal halves each time.
Average Case O(n log n): The expected performance for random input data.
Worst Case O(n²): Occurs when the pivot is consistently the smallest or largest element, creating highly unbalanced partitions.
Empirical Results:
The implementation demonstrates:

Increasing the input size from 100 to 1000 elements results in more than linear but less than quadratic growth in execution time
Sequence B (100 elements) sorts significantly faster than Sequence C (1000 elements)
Pre-sorted or nearly sorted sequences can be processed extremely efficiently
Worst-case scenarios (reverse-sorted arrays) show significantly higher execution times
Summary and Conclusions
The Quicksort algorithm implementation demonstrates why it remains one of the most widely used sorting algorithms:

Efficiency: It performs exceptionally well for average-case scenarios, making it suitable for most real-world applications.
Scalability: The performance scales well with increasing input sizes, following the O(n log n) complexity.
Limitations: Care must be taken to avoid worst-case O(n²) scenarios, which can be mitigated by using different pivot selection strategies.
Trade-offs: While not the simplest sorting algorithm to implement, its performance advantages outweigh the implementation complexity for large datasets.
This project provides a comprehensive understanding of Quicksort, from theoretical foundations to practical implementation, with empirical performance data to validate the theoretical analysis.
